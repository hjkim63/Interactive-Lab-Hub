- 11/29: present prototyped device
- 12/6: costumed device + demo presentation
- 12/16: final reporting 

**Parts needed**
- Soil moisture sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Rain sensor, etc.

**Risks/contingencies**
- Wifi connections in community gardens
- Diverse-background of users that are connected to this system
- Weather conditions â†’ plan to costume!
